## Food Expense Handling

### Daily Food Allowance Calculation

```
Daily Food Allowance = Monthly Food Allowance / Days in Month

Example:
- Monthly Food Allowance: ₹2,200
- Days in January: 31
- Daily Allowance: ₹2,200 / 31 = ₹70.97
```

### Credit Scenarios

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Attendance approved | Credit food expense |
| Regularized to PRESENT | Credit food expense |
| Force attendance (PRESENT + APPROVED) | Credit food expense |

### Reversal Scenarios

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Approved → Rejected | Reverse food expense |
| PRESENT → ABSENT | Reverse food expense |
| PRESENT → LEAVE | Reverse food expense |
| PRESENT → HOLIDAY | Reverse food expense |

### Reference IDs

| Type | Format |
|------|--------|
| Credit | `ATT_FOOD_{userId}_{date}` |
| Reversal | `ATT_FOOD_REV_{userId}_{date}` |

---

## Leave Balance Handling

### Leave Credit (Balance Returned)

When regularizing **FROM LEAVE** to another status:

```
1. Find leave application for the date
2. Decrement consumed by 1: consumed = consumed - 1
3. If single-day leave: Cancel the leave application
4. If multi-day leave: Just credit back (can't cancel partial)
```

### Leave Debit (Balance Consumed)

When regularizing **TO LEAVE** (Force Leave):

```
1. Validate leaveCategory is provided
2. Check leave balance exists for category
3. Validate sufficient balance (≥ 1 day)
4. Increment consumed by 1: consumed = consumed + 1
5. Create forced leave application record
```

### Multi-day Leave Handling

When an employee has a multi-day leave (e.g., Jan 5-10) and only one day is regularized:

| Day | Original Status | After Regularization |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|
| Jan 5 | LEAVE | LEAVE |
| Jan 6 | LEAVE | LEAVE |
| Jan 7 | LEAVE | **PRESENT** (regularized) |
| Jan 8 | LEAVE | LEAVE |
| Jan 9 | LEAVE | LEAVE |
| Jan 10 | LEAVE | LEAVE |

- ✅ 1 day credited back to leave balance
- ❌ Leave application NOT cancelled (other days still valid)
- 📝 Log entry created for audit

---

## Force Attendance

### During Shift
```
- Status: PENDING (requires approval)
- Food expense: NOT credited (will be credited on approval)
```

### After Shift (Same Day)
```
- Status: APPROVED
- Food expense: CREDITED immediately
- Requires: Check-in and check-out times
```

### Previous Day
```
- Status: APPROVED
- Food expense: CREDITED immediately
- Requires: Check-in and check-out times
```
